```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  This is a gradient background
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient feature.  However, if the `to-purple-500` class is accidentally written as `to-purple-5000` (an extra 0), it will not render the gradient correctly because `purple-5000` is not a valid Tailwind class. The error will be silent, causing unexpected behavior.
