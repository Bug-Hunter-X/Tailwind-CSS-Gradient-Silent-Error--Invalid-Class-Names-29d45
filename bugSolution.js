```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  This is a gradient background
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- Always double-check the validity of your Tailwind classes using the Tailwind CSS documentation or your IDE's IntelliSense features.
- Utilize linters or other code analysis tools to catch potential issues.
- When designing complex gradients, test them thoroughly to ensure they render as expected.
